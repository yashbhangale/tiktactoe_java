This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java. The game features a simple, user-friendly interface and allows players to play against each other or against an AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move, making it a challenging opponent.

The game has been implemented using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, making it easy to understand, modify and enhance. The game can be run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

This project serves as a great example of how a simple game can be implemented using Java and the OOP paradigm. It can be used as a learning resource for students, or as a starting point for anyone looking to build a more complex game or application.

You may need to update the description according to your implementation or additional functionality you added to the game. Feel free to edit it as per your requirement
